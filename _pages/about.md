Hello! I am a fifth year mathematics PhD candidate at the University of Washington. My [research interests](research.md) are in motivic and chromatic homotopy theory, and my advisors are [Kyle Ormsby](https://kyleormsby.github.io/) and [John Palmieri](https://sites.math.washington.edu//~palmieri/). Things that I am interested in include:
* Periodicity in the motivic/equivariant/classical stable stems
* Computations with the Adams spectral sequence
* Height shifting phenomena and the telescope conjecture

**I am currently on the academic job market.**

I received my BS from the University of Kentucky in December 2020 and my Master's from UW in June 2023. [Here is my CV](/files/CV.pdf) (updated January 2026). I can be contacted at jackmann at uw dot edu.

In Spring 2026, I am teaching [Math 480 - Homotopy Theory](math480_spring_2026.md). Send me an email if you are an interested student at UW!

<!-- I try to collect resources which I have found useful on various topics. Feel free to email me if you have anything to contribute! -->
