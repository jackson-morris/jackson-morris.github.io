A fundamental question in topology is the following: given two topological spaces
$X$ and $Y$, how can one determine if there is an equivalence $X \cong Y$? One way to probe this question is to study algebraic invariants of X and Y . For example, there is an invariant called the fundamental group of a space, denoted by $\pi_1(-)$, and if $\pi_1(X) \not\cong \pi_1(Y)$, then in fact $X \not\cong Y$.

However, rather than merely assigning algebraic invariants, we can also study nice properties of the spaces themselves. For example, if one can show that a continuous function $∗ → X$ is a cofibration, then in fact $*\cong X$. These two perspectives, of using algebraic invariants to study spaces and exhibiting properties of spaces which are invariant, combine together to create homotopy theory.

This course will be an introduction to the methods used in homotopy theory. We will study algebraic invariants of spaces called homotopy groups and learn basic tools for calculation. Along the way, we will develop ways to treat topological spaces themselves as a more algebraic gadget, with an eye towards stable homotopy theory. Towards this goal, we will introduce a language known as category theory that will allow us to pass between and directly compare topology and algebra. This course will end with a final presentation on a topic of the your choice.
