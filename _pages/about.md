Hello! I am a fifth year mathematics PhD candidate at the University of Washington, where my advisors are [Kyle Ormsby](https://kyleormsby.github.io/) and [John Palmieri](https://sites.math.washington.edu//~palmieri/). This fall, I will be a postdoc at SLMath as a part of their [semester program on motivic homotopy theory](https://www.slmath.org/programs/384). Starting in January 2027, I will be a Postdoc at Vanderbilt University.

My [research interests](research.md) are in motivic and chromatic homotopy theory. I am generally interested in periodicity in all flavors of stable homotopy theory.


<!-- I received my BS from the University of Kentucky in December 2020 and my Master's from UW in June 2023.  -->

[Here is my CV](/files/CV.pdf) (updated January 2026). I can be contacted at jackmann at uw dot edu.

In Spring 2026, I am teaching [Math 480 - Homotopy Theory](math480_spring_2026.md). Send me an email if you are an interested student at UW!

<!-- I try to collect resources which I have found useful on various topics. Feel free to email me if you have anything to contribute! -->
