**Source paper:** [On the ring of cooperations for real Hermitian K-theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16672)

**Source abstract:** Let $\text{kq}$ denote the very effective cover of the motivic Hermitian K-theory spectrum. We analyze the ring of cooperations $\pi_{**}^\mathbb{R}(\text{kq} \otimes \text{kq})$ in the stable motivic homotopy category $\text{SH}(\mathbb{R})$, giving a full description in terms of Brown--Gitler comodules. To do this, we decompose the $\text{E}_2$-page of the motivic Adams spectral sequence and show that it must collapse. The description of the $\text{E}_2$-page is accomplished by a series of algebraic Atiyah--Hirzebruch spectral sequences which converge to the summands of the $\text{E}_2$-page. Along the way, we prove a splitting result for the very effective symplectic K-theory $\text{ksp}$ over any base field of characteristic not two.
