    This webpage has a great selection of notes accompanying the many mini-courses from PCMI 2024. Touches on a whole bunch of topics. Particular notes I enjoy are Burt Totaro's notes on classifying spaces, Kirsten Wickelgren's notes on Weil conjectures, Frederic Deglise's notes on characteristic classes, and Sabrina Pauli's notes on enumerative geometry.

    All Talbot notes are good, and these ones especially have many gems.

    Just filled to the brim with everything I've ever wanted to know about stable homotopy groups. Ends with a nice set of open problems.

    Hands on, infinity-categorical approach to the stable motivic homtoopy category. Does the slice spectral sequence. Low bar for entry!
