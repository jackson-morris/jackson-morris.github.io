**Source paper:** [Rings of cooperations for Hermitian K-theory over finite fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02786)

**Source abstract:** We compute the ring of cooperations $\pi_{**}^{\mathbb{F}_q}(\text{kq} \otimes \text{kq})$ for the very effective Hermitian K-theory over all finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ where $\text{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) \neq 2$. To do this, we use the motivic Adams spectral
sequence and show that all differentials are determined by the integral motivic cohomology of $\mathbb{F}_q$.
As an application, we compute the $\text{E}_1$-page of the $\text{kq}$-resolution.

Background on the problem
===
The background on this problem is the same as the background for the case of $F=\mathbb{R}$, which I wrote about [here](guide_real_kq_coop.md). The only difference is that, instead of computing over $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, I just chose to compute in $\text{SH}(\mathbb{F}_q)$.
