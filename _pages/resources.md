<!-- On this webpage, I have included things that I have read on particular topics in and related to homotopy theory. I have also included open problems that I have found throughout the literature. This is is motivated by various other webpages/documents:
* https://www.homotopytheory.info/ A great website with collected resources on category theory, spectra, infinite loop spaces, simplicial methods, spectral sequences, vector bundles and topological K-theory, algebraic K-theory, G-spectra, and chromatic homotopy theory.
* [Voevodsky's Open Problems in Motivic Stable Homotopy Theory](https://www.math.ias.edu/Voevodsky/files/files-original/Dropbox/Published_papers/Motives/Open/Stage3/newopen.pdf)
* [Mark Hovey's algebraic topology problem list](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~tlawson/hovey/)
* Someone's (not sure who used to own this site) [problems in homotopy theory](https://web.archive.org/web/20210305022827/http://topology-octopus.herokuapp.com/problemsinhomotopytheory/show/HomePage)
* [Any of the open problem lists generated by an AIM workshop](https://aimath.org/problemlists/)

I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything. This primarily began as a place to compile those excellent write-ups that people find in the far corners of the internet, usually written by some random graduate student giving a talk in their local seminar. I find these documents very useful. I am also someone who learns by doing instead of by reading, meaning that I really enjoy papers that have applications of techniques instead of ones which are more "foundational". If you have anything you'd like to contribute, whether something you have written, something you have read that is particularly pleasing, a topic that isn't represented that should be represented, an open problem/conjecture that should be included ,etc... please let me know. This is, and hopefully will always be, a work in progress!  -->
