On this page are open problems and resources in various topics in motivic homotopy theory. The resources in motivic homotopy theory that I have found useful tend to be papers.

    This webpage has a great selection of notes accompanying the many mini-courses from PCMI 2024. Touches on a whole bunch of topics. Particular notes I enjoy are Burt Totaro's notes on classifying spaces, Kirsten Wickelgren's notes on Weil conjectures, Frederic Deglise's notes on characteristic classes, and Sabrina Pauli's notes on enumerative geometry.

    Hermitian K-theory plays a very important role in stable motivic homotopy theory. It is often useful to consider the Hermitian K-theory spectrum as a motivic analogue of real topological K-theory spectrum.
