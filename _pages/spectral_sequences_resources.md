    The bo-resolution is the bo-based Adams spectral       sequence.

    <li> <a href= "https://projecteuclid.org/journals/pacific-journal-of-mathematics/volume-92/issue-2/brm-o-resolutions/pjm/1102736799.full">bo-resolutions</a>, Mark Mahowald. Mahowald studies the bo-resolution for the first time in this paper. He uses the spectral sequence to compute the 2-primary v1-periodic stable homotopy groups of spheres. the results are later used, or suitably interpreted here, to prove the height 1 telescope conjecture at the prime 2.
