* **$\text{bo}$-resolution**
    <details>
    <summary>See more</summary>
    The bo-resolution is the bo-based Adams spectral       sequence.

    <li> <a href= "https://projecteuclid.org/journals/pacific-journal-of-mathematics/volume-92/issue-2/brm-o-resolutions/pjm/1102736799.full">bo-resolutions</a>, Mark Mahowald. Mahowald studies the bo-resolution for the first time in this paper. He uses the spectral sequence to compute the 2-primary v1-periodic stable homotopy groups of spheres. the results are later used, or suitably interpreted here, to prove the height 1 telescope conjecture at the prime 2.

    <details>
    <summary>See more</summary>
    The Bokstedt spectral sequence is a tool for computing the homology of the THH of a ring.

    <li> <a href ="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0502195">Hopf Algebra Structures on Topological Hochschild Homology</a>, Vigeik Angeltveit and John Rognes. A terrific paper to read if you want to start getting your hands dirty with computations using the Bokstedt spectral sequence in the context of chromatic homotopy theory, redshift, the Adams spectral sequence, etc.
